Oh alright.<p>

The name's James.<br>
James "Listless Procrastinator" McCormack.<br>
I'm 20.<br>
Say it loud, I'm white and not-particularly-proud.<br>
I'm from Nottingham in England.<p>

I like pot-noodles (chicken and mushroom flavour! ;).<br>
I like beer.<br>
I like playing my guitar. I have played in the following bands. They have all failed miserably.<p>
<ul>
1. Bopfodder.<br>
2. Salmon By Accident.<br>
3. Girls Can Kill.<br>
4. The Gentle Bens.<br>
5. Ouch!<br>
6. Spring Thing.<br>
7. The Rotating Dead Hendrix Experience.<br>
8. The Immortal Twigs.<br>
9. The Purple Velvet Alice Band.<br>
10. Michael Jackson (miserable failure AND received death threats!)<p></ul>
I have a 90% complete degree in Information Systems from the <a href=http://www.leeds.ac.uk>University of Leeds</a> (fail pending) in 
<a href=http://www.eranu.demon.co.uk/york.htm>Yorkshire</a>. I never wanted to be in computing.. I always wanted to be.... a lumberjack! (etc. etc. etc.)<p>

I have a bordering-on-nerdsville interest in LOUD HI-FI and CARS. Please do not start a conversation with me on either of these subjects, it will be bad for your health and the trade deficit.<p>

I am, predictably, single ;)<p>

I like design and architecture and art and poetry and books and cinema and thingles. My favourite book is CATCH-22 by Joseph Heller. My favourite film is GREGORY'S GIRL. My favourite poet is JOHN HEGLEY. My favourite type of art is PRE-RAPHAELITE. My favourite architect is CHARLES RENNIE MACKINTOSH. My favourite design types are ART DECO, ART NOUVEAU, ARTS & CRAFTS and the design of the future! Give it up for DESIGNER's REPUBLIC! [links aplenty]<p>

I hate religion, and I hate bigotry. I love stereotypes.<p>

I'm thirsty. That's enough about me. You want to ask me something? Then send a mail, frootbat!<p>
