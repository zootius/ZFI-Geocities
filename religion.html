<h1><font color=#ffffff>Heresy Made Simple</font></h1>

Eeeh. Religion. Daft business. A tool for social control? A man-made prank that's gone too far? A comfort-blanket for the ignorant? An excuse for major-league fisticuffs?<p>

Maybe.<p>

We have many religions for you to choose from here at the Funbag.<p>
<table border=5 width=65%><tr><td>
<font color=#ffff00>Islam.</font><br> Don't mess. And I didn't send you.
</tr></td>
<tr><td>
<font color=#ffff00>Buddhism.</font><br> Peace, tranquility, harmony and rioting (22/3/97). Fun!
</tr></td>
<tr><td>
<font color=#ffff00>Christianity.</font><br> Dead red 2000 years under the bed. Comes in several flavours: Catholicism's best cos you can be an absolute bastard all through your life as long as you remember to repent just before you cop it. No protected shaggy-shaggy though, and no shaggy-shaggy at all if you're a Priest (unless you really really want to do it - then you have to be very quiet.. shhh!). 
</tr></td>
<tr><td>
<font color=#ffff00>Hinduism.</font><br> Millions of gods to choose from here, and they come in some way-out colour schemes. They also have freely interchangeable heads. Cool!
</tr></td>
<tr><td>
<a href=judas.html><strong>Judas</strong>ism.</a></font><br> Some GREAT ideas here. Especially the bit about gerbils.
</tr></td>
<tr><td>
<font color=#ffff00>Judaism.</font><br> Oy veh. Miserable bunch, no wonder everyone picks on 'em. Yok, what a maumser! Did I really say that? How HEARTLESS!
</tr></td>
<tr><td>
<font color=#ffff00>Zootfrootism.</font><br> Well I thought it was good.
</tr></td>
<tr><td>
<font color=#ffff00>Scientology.</font><br> the original and THE BEST! come on you fat gits, eat some muesli and give up your wallet to L-Ron! You're gonna be OT! Yayyyyy!
</tr></td>
<tr><td>
<font color=#ffff00>Atheism.</font><br> The fashionable choice.. but THINK! If you don't buy a ticket, you're sure not to win the raffle!</tr></td></table></center><p>

Be careful how you choose. If you get it wrong, it's PERMANENT. You may go to hell. You may come back as a worm, a pig, or a fire hydrant. You may not come back at all. Nobody said it was going to be easy!<p>
